# Sequential learning

This repo contains resources to test a few online convex optimization / best arm identification in bandits algorithms.

## Online convex optimization

* Online gradient descent
* Online gradient descend without gradient

## Best arm identification in stochastic bandits

### Fixed budget

* Uniform sampling
* Successive rejects

#### Fixed confidence

* UCB-based with heuristic approximation of the GLRT stopping rule
* Uniform sampling with heuristic approximation of the GLRT stopping rule
* TTUCB (Top two with arm drawn by UCB as the leader)
* EB-TC (Top two with empirically best arm as the leader)
